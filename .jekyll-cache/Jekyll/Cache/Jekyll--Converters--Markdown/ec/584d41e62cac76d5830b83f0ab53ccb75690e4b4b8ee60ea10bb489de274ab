<p>Hello, my name is Larry. I am a current graduate student at Georgia Tech pursuing my MSc in Analytics, coming from a background in mechanical engineering.</p>

<p>I am actively looking for new opportunities to develop my skills in data science. The process of extracting insights from data is something that I enjoy, and I hope to achieve this with my skills in Python and mathematics.</p>

<p>Before beginning my journey in analytics, I worked under two leading biomedical research professors as a research assistant for a year. I helped design a portable device that safely and efficiently freezes liver cells. After graduation, I worked as an automation engineer for a year, where I was in charge of designing automated HVAC systems for commercial buildings. Over these years, I have acquired the necessary skills to solve problems using innovative and creative solutions.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about topics such as space exploration, artificial intelligence, cars, traveling, and music! During my free time, youâ€™ll find me cycling, fishkeeping, hiking, playing guitar.</p>
