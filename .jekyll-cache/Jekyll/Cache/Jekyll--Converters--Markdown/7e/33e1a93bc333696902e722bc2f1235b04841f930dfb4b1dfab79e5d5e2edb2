I"‘<p>Safe drinking water is a basic human right, whether used for drinking, food production, or basic hygiene. Although 70% of the earthâ€™s surface is covered in water, there are still countries and communities that lack easy access to safe drinking water. Unsafe drinking water can be contaminated with hazardous chemical and animal waste, and dangerous amounts of naturally occurring substances.</p>
