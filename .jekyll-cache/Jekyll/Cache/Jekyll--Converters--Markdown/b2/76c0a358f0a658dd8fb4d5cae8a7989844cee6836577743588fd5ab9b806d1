<p>A random walk is a path created by a series of choices, each of which is left entirely to chance. Random walks have practical applications in several areas of academia such as physics and economics.</p>

<p>In this case, each step will consist of a randomly chosen set of coordinates (each between 0 and Â±4). The program can produce simple to complex random walks by changing the number of points (default number of points is 10,000).</p>
